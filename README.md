Introduction
This project involved developing the classic 2048 game using Python. The game was implemented using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and incorporated three main files: the game logic file (using the random library), the UI file (using the Tkinter library), and a constants file for managing the game's visual appearance. The aim of the project was to create an interactive and visually appealing version of the 2048 game, leveraging Python's capabilities to handle game logic and GUI design.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:
•	To implement the core game logic of 2048, including tile merging and random tile generation.
•	To design a user-friendly graphical interface for the game.
•	To manage game constants effectively to ensure a consistent and appealing GUI.
•	To integrate the game logic with the GUI to provide a seamless gaming experience.

Resources and Requirements
Software and Tools
•	Visual Studio Code (VS Code): IDE used for coding and debugging.
•	Python 3.x: Programming language used to develop the game.
Libraries:
•	random: Used for generating random tiles.
•	tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
Hardware
•	A computer with a modern operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
•	Sufficient memory and processing power to run Python applications.
